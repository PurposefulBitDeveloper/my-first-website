        <b>What is Java?</b><br><br>

        Java is a broadly useful PC programming language that is simultaneous, class-based, object-situated, and explicitly intended to have as scarcely any execution conditions as could really be expected. It is proposed to let application engineers “compose once, run anyplace” (WORA), implying that gathered Java code can run on all stages that help Java without the requirement for recompilation.<br></p>

        This variant of Java is for the most part focused for the applications running on inserted frameworks, mobiles and little gadgets. Additionally, the J2ME applications help in utilizing web pressure innovations, which thus, diminish network use, and consequently modest web openness. J2ME utilizes numerous libraries and API’s of J2SE, just as, large numbers of it’s own. The fundamental point of this version was to deal with mobiles, remote gadgets, set top boxes and so forth Old Nokia telephones, which utilized Symbian OS, utilized this innovation.<br><br>
