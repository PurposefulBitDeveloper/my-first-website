            <b>What is 5g internet?</b><br><br>

        5G stands for fifth generation of wireless technology.<br>

        5G is a generation currently work in progress. It is said to have very fast data rates, higher connection power, much lower latency, and other improvements also and the maximum speed of 5G is said to be as fast as 35.46 Gbps!<br>

        Important technologies to look out for – Massive MIMO, Millimeter Wave Mobile Communications, etc. Li-fi which is nowadays replacing wi-fi as it is an example of 5g (but not totally 5g) it can give up to 10gbps/s per user and supports at least 100 billion devices!<br>

            <b>First, What is this “G” in 1G, 2G , 3G, 4G, 5G?</b><br><br>
            <b>The “G” stands for generation.</b><br>
            <b>What is 1G internet ?</b><br>
            1G internet means the first generation of wireless technology and also known as cell phone technology, It’s development time was1970-1984 and it has come into the world in 1987. The maximum internet speed of this network was 2.4 kbps.<br>
            
            <b>What is 2G internet?</b><br>
            The main time of 2G was 1980-1999. and the main difference between 1g and 2g is 1g uses analog signals while 2g uses digital signals. 2g technology carried out the idea of CDMA and GSM.<br>
            
            <b>What is 3g internet ?</b><br>
            The 3G standard uses another innovation called UMTS as its center organization engineering – Universal Mobile Telecommunications System. This organization consolidates parts of the 2G organization with some new innovation and conventions to convey an altogether quicker information rate.
            
            <b>What is 4g internet?</b><br>
            The motivation of 4g internet is to give high speed, superior grade, and high ability to clients while improving security and reducing the cost of internet services, information administrations and web over IP(Internet Protocol) by the way The most contributing technologies that have made this happen are – MIMO(Multiple Input Multiple Output) and OFDM(Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) and the two important 4G standards are WiMAX (has now failed out) and LTE (has seen widespread deployment).<br>
            
            <b>Are Companies like Jio, Vodafone, Airtel giving 5G routers?</b><br>
            Vodafone Idea is all ready to give 5G network in India  when the spectrum will be made and available through auction.<br>
            
            Concerning 5G in India Airtel as of now has 5G prepared innovation, Jio has declared that they will be ready to convey 5G innovation in the second half of 2021, Earlier it was said to be in mid-2020 but because of Covid 19, it was postponed.<br>
            
            <b>Are 5g supporting mobile phones available in India?</b><br>
            Yes of course, there are many 5g supporting phones avaliable in India even under ₹30,000.<br>
